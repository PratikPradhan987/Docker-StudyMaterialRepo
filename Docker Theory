What is docker

Docker is an open-source platform 
It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications in containers. 

Containers are isolated environments that allow you to package an application with all its dependencies 
and run it on any machine without worrying about compatibility issues. 

Docker provides a unified way to manage and distribute applications as containers
which makes it easier to develop, test, and deploy applications in different environments.


What is docker containers 

A Docker container is a standalone executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software.
Including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

Containers are isolated from each other and from the host system.
Which allows multiple containers to run on the same host without affecting each other or the host. 

This makes containers a lightweight and portable alternative to virtual machines, as they use fewer resources and are faster to start. 

Docker provides a platform to create, manage, and distribute containers,
making it easier to build, ship, and run applications in a variety of environments.
