what is docker

Docker is an open-source platform 
It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications in containers. 

Containers are isolated environments that allow you to package an application with all its dependencies 
and run it on any machine without worrying about compatibility issues. 

Docker provides a unified way to manage and distribute applications as containers
which makes it easier to develop, test, and deploy applications in different environments.
